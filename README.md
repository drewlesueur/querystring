# querystring
querystring encoder for Go

This project is inspired by [`go-querystring`](https://github.com/google/go-querystring).

This supports maps, slices, and arrays, but doesn't support structs yet (pull requests welcome).

I started to work on a fork of go-querystring but decided to write my own as a learning experience and because I thought it would be easier.
It might be nice to one day merge this into go-querystring once it's more fully baked.

See the tests for example usage.
